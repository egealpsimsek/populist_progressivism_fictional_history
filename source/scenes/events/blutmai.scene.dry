= Factory Day, 1919

Tensions run high across Casoducria. Factory Day, the official labour holiday of Casoducria has allowed hundreds of thousands of workers to have the freedom to strike, in support of their slaughtered comrades in Istharville and all across Casoducria. Idris Abbal, leader of the CPCM has whipped up quite the revolutionary frenzy amongst the workers, rightfully angered by the oppression of their comrades. SPC leader Strentin Vilmer has joined this cause, advocating for either a revolution or a decisive Constiutional Reform that he knows will never come to fruition.

Many fear another Little Army crackdown, as was in Istharville, and demand action from the Constitutional Convention as the provisional government. A great reckoning is about to begin in the Convention, as Socialists, Communists and Trade Unionist prepare a walkout. We are forced to act, one way or the other.

- @condemn: Condemn Socialist Transgressions.
- @negotiate_disarm: Condemn both Little Army and Socialist militancy and call for widespread reform.
- @negotiate: Condemn the Little Army and call for widespread reform.
- @walkout: Join with the socialists in their Conventional Walkout.

We have officially condemned the militancy of the socialist and communist militias, and voiced our support for a peaceful compromise. Predictably this has caused significant anger from the left, and predictably violence erupted. Reports indicate that over the weekend more than 250 workers were killed or grievly wounded by Little Army soldiers. The Communists are already calling this incident *Krwawy StyczeÅ„*, "Bloody January".

Could we still possibly salvage the situation? Is a civil war destined to engulf Casoducria, just like it engulfed Pilovia? Where will the TACC stand on the side of history?.

- @la_fault: It is the fault of the Little Army's transgressions and Allen Pazceky's failures. Punish the Little Army!
- @communist_fault: It is the fault of the Communists for refusing to follow the rule of law.
- @no_fault: It is an unfortunate incident that should not have happened, but is no one's fault at all.

We decried the Little Army for their naked transgressions, and thus we have managed to force through a motion aimed at punishing and weakening the Little Army. [? if nationalist_strenght >= 30 : Unfortunately, the nationalist faction of the TACC under Semyonov have refused to endorse our position. ?]

This assuages some of the Socialist's outrage, but certainly not all.

If the workers want to continue refusing compromise, they will inevitably suffer the consequences. Thus, we have banded together with the Nationalist Party to limit the ability of the Crimson Corps, their paramilitary group, to organise. The bourgeois and right-leaning parties approve.

@no_fault

This position gains us no allies, and does not alienate anyone any further. At a time of decisive crisis, we have refused to take decisive action.

Negotiations between local labour leaders in the South and East of the country and the Constitutional Convention begins. Most councils refuse to disarm pre-emptively, and what little compromise can be found proves worthless.

Negotiations between local labour leaders in the South and East of the country and the Constitutional Convention begins, with surprisingly many socialists willing to negotiate. Seeing the potential of a democratic compromise, the SPC and Strentin Vilmer force their side to the negotiating table. Unfortunatly, the Little Army and the Nationalist Party break off negotiations before an agreement can be reached. The workers councils use this time to gather munitions, organise barricades and militarily prepare (allowing them a stronger position militarily). Our centrist allies denounce our choices, but their cries are ineffectual.

It is difficult to persuade the TACC to actually go through with the walkout, and barely 60% of our members do so, as the Nationalist Faction split off to form their own organisation. However, the remaining TACC members eventually organise their walkout alongside the Socialists. This display of progressive-socialist unity inspires the workers and terrifies the bourgeoisie and middle class. Nationalists and Liberals are outraged at our display with the communists, and are threatening to crush us alongside them. The far-right paramilitaries increase their recruitment to counter us.
