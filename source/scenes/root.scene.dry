> *"The political basis of a nation, no matter it's size and material potency, must always rest at the behest of an elite. Every political system in existance creates an elite, a ruling class, a distance betweent he ruler and the ruled. Any political system not based in total popular participitation must therefore be distanced from the people, the worker, the farmer; and therefore it must inevitably struggle against the ruled. This is the fundemental basis of all modern politics; to distract the ruled from rising up against the ruler."*

 - Karol Maximov, *On the Precipice of Revolution,* 1863

Progressive Populism: A Fictional History is a mod about a completely fictional setting, using the mechanics of autumn_chan's "Social Democracy: An Alternate History" and originn0's "Dynamic Social Democracy". This mod puts you in the position of <span style="color: #FF9530;">The All-Casoducrian Congress</span> or the <span style="color: #FF9530;">**TACC**</span>, a populist movement founded by a disgruntled veteran of the Great War by the name of August von Begea as it navigates the foundation of the Casoducrian Republic, it's formative years and it's struggle against both the <span style="color: #A60505;">Communist Revolutionaries</span> and the <span style="color: #CABFBF;">Reactionaries</span> and it's attempts at complete transformation of the fictional country of <span style="color: #4D4C75;">**Casoducria**</span> From an Agrarian backwards country ruled by a semi-absolute monarchy into a Progressive Paradise. In this game, you are not exactly Social Democrats or Liberals. The TACC, if we are using Weimar era political terms, would encompass the right and neorevisionist factions of the SPD, the left faction of the DDP and would incorporate patriotic and militaristic elements in it's ideology.

The goal of the mod is to create an enviroment where a few dominoes can set off a chain reaction that completely reverberates to create a new Casoducria. In the immediate aftermath of the Great War mere individuals, charismatic deal breakers and men who happened to be at the right place at the right time would dictate aspects of constitutions, the very foundations of republics; as was the case in our timeline.

Your primary goal is to create a truly <span style="color: #FF0000;">Dem</span><span style="color: #2AE8E8;">ocr</span><span style="color: #20C745;">atic</span> <span style="color: #4D4C75;">Casoducria</span>, achieving <span style="color: #FF9530;">Progressivism</span> is secondary.

= 1928

The Great War is over. Thoubian Forces are within 26 kilometers of Matklingrad, and the Monarch has already fled to Orthaland, away from both the Thoubians and his own fellow countrymen. The Kingdom of Casoducria lays in ruins, most of it's government incapacitated. 

Now, from the ashes of this collapse rises a bitter veteran, August von Begea. He and 21 others, including Herman G√∂ething, has signed a pledge to create "The All Casoducrian Congress", a party of progressives aimed at elevating the people of Casoducria. But first, the collapse of the Kingdom must end, and a Republic must be declared.
